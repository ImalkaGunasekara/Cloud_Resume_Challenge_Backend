# Here's why each is necessary:

# Method Response: This configuration defines the expected responses for each HTTP status code that your API might return. It specifies the status codes that your API method can produce and optionally the headers for each status code. It essentially tells API Gateway how to respond to requests before integrating with the backend.

# Integration Response: Once API Gateway receives a response from your backend service, the integration response configuration dictates how that response should be transformed before being sent back to the client. This includes mapping backend response headers/body to HTTP response headers/body, applying response transformations, and handling errors.

# Both configurations are crucial for ensuring your API Gateway setup handles requests and responses correctly. The method response defines what the API is capable of returning, and the integration response defines how to process the actual responses from the backend service before sending them back to the client.


# If you are using the console, these things  do not have to be defined, but in here you have to do it.

# Another important thing is that, make sure to have the return statement in your Lambda function with a status code of '200'
